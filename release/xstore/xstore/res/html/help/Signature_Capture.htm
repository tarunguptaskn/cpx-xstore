<h1>Signature Capture</h1>
<p>Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service displays the Signature Entry form 
 while the customer signs the capture device attached to the register. 
 </p>
<p><img src="CapturingSigScreen.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<p>When the customer selects the Accept option on the signature capture 
 device, Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service automatically displays the 
 customer’s signature on this form so you can compare the captured signature 
 with the customer’s signature on the credit card (or other document if 
 applicable). </p>
<p>Press [Enter] if the signature matches the signature on the card. If 
 the signature does not match, press [Esc] to return focus to the signature 
 capture device and ask the customer to either write the signature again 
 or choose to cancel rather than re-signing. </p>
<p>If the customer chooses the Cancel option, you have the option to Retry 
 and ask the customer to sign on the signature capture device again, or 
 to Skip the process and capture the customer’s signature manually on the 
 receipt. </p>
<p>The Signature Entry form displays if the customer selects Cancel on 
 the signature capture device. </p>
