<h1>Till Accountability Process</h1>
<p>There are two types of till management: Register Accountability and 
 Till Accountability.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Register Accountability</span>: 
 A till is assigned to a register which allows any cashier to use the register. 
 The first associate who signs on to the register is responsible for opening 
 the till. The associate is then required to count the drawer. This process 
 assigns the drawer to the current register. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Till Accountability</span>: 
 A till is assigned to a specific cashier. The assigned till can be attached 
 to any register the cashier may work on during the day. The cashier must 
 count the assigned till and then attach the till to a cash drawer/register 
 before ringing transactions. At the end of the cashier's shift, the cashier 
 must count and return the assigned till to the cash management office 
 for reconciliation. This process transfers responsibility for the assigned 
 till back to the cash manager.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Arial Rounded MT Bold', sans-serif;">The 
 till accountability process follows a sequence of steps that require till 
 counts whenever the till is moved or given to another person. These steps 
 provide additional checks on the tills at every change in the status of 
 the tills.</span> </p>
