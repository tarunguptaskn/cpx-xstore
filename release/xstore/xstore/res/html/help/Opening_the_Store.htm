<h1>Opening the Store</h1>
<p>The store open process must be performed on only one register. The store 
 open procedure signals that the store is open to all registers. Once the 
 store is open, sales cannot be rung until the register is opened and a 
 till is counted for the register. </p>
<p>The Register Open and Store Open menu options toggle between open and 
 close. The Store Open menu option indicates that this store is currently 
 closed. The Register Open menu option indicates that this register is 
 also closed. </p>
<ol style="font-weight: normal;" type="a">

	 to confirm that you want to open the store. Select Yes to continue 
	 with the open store process.</li>
	<li class="Numbering">If prompted to confirm the business date, select 
	 Yes to confirm the date and continue with the open store process.</li>
