<h1>Training Mode</h1>
<p>Training Mode allows you to train new employees on the system—at both 
 the POS Register and in the Back Office—without being concerned that any 
 live data may be impacted. </p>
<p>Training Mode allows store employees to simulate most, if not all, of 
 the functions provided by Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service in normal 
 operating mode. Any transactions performed in Training Mode are distinguished 
 from transactions conducted in operating mode in several ways. First, 
 the data elements associated with live and training transactions are separated 
 from each other. In addition, any artifacts related to them, such as receipts, 
 reports, etc., are also kept separately. </p>
<p>Your system’s configuration applies to both the live and training modes. 
 For example, if you are using Till Accountability in the live mode, the 
 rules for Till Accountability also apply in training mode. Even though 
 a till may be attached to the register in live mode, the first time that 
 you log into the training mode you must assign a till to an employee and 
 attach a till to the register from the Back Office. </p>
<p>You can exit training mode at any time and return to live operating 
 mode.</p>
<p>You can perform most functions exactly the same way as when the register 
 is in normal production mode. However, the following functions cannot 
 be performed while the register is in Training Mode: </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet">The cash drawer does not open. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">No authorizations or settlements can be performed. 
	 </li>
	<li class="Bullet">Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service does not communicate 
	 with the Environment The Environment is an application that interacts 
	 with Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service and the operating system 
	 to perform some critical functions, particularly during store opening 
	 and closing. For this reason, you can simulate a store close without 
	 impacting live operations in your store. </li>
</ul>
