<h1>Close Count</h1>
<p>The Close Count function provides the capability to declare final amounts 
 for all the tender groups when a till is closed at any time. The system 
 displays the values for each group in the System Amount column and any 
 overages or shortages are indicated in the Over/Short column on the Close 
 Count screen (if your system is configured to display them). If any of 
 the tender groups are not in balance when an attempt is made to close 
 a till, the system displays a warning message indicating which groups 
 are out of balance. You may decide to accept the differences or to correct 
 them before final closing. </p>
<ol type="1">
	<li class="Numbering">At the Count Summary screen, use the up or down 
	 arrow keys to select (highlight) a count group. Select the Count Selected 
	 option on the menu.</li>
</ol>
<table style="margin-top: 8px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" 
		 cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;" />
	<tr>
		<td><p>Note: The Count Group you select determines the requirements 
		 for doing the count. For example, if you select Cash, you may 
		 need to count the total value of each denomination in the till. 
		 But if you select Check, you may need to indicate the number of 
		 checks in the till and their total value.</p></td>
	</tr>

<ol start="2" type="1">
	<li>Enter the required values according to the Count Group that you 
	 selected. The value of the Total Amount updates each time you make 
	 or change an entry, and it should equal the value for the same Count 
	 Group displayed on the Count Summary screen.</li>
	<li>After completing the count for a group, select the Next Group option 
	 to display the count screen for the next sequential tender group in 
	 the list. It is always the group immediately below the current group 
	 on the Count Summary screen.</li>
