<h1>Shipping</h1>
<p>The shipping function provides the ability to record the transfer of 
 physical inventory to another store, vendor, warehouse, or customer. It 
 also includes the creation of documents such as packing slips and shipping 
 labels that are related to the transfer and provides the ability to search 
 for a shipping document in order to edit or view it. Some transaction 
 types, such as work order repairs, may automatically generate shipping 
 documents at the point of sale. They can be processed using the shipping 
 function in the Back Office. You can also view and print a Shipping Exception 
 Report. Refer to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Oracle Retail Xstore 
 Point of Service Reports Guide</span> for more information about this 
 report. </p>
<p>If the document you are looking for is not found in the list of Shipping 
 Documents, or you know a document does not exist, select the Add New option 
 at the Shipping Document search results form to create a new Shipping 
 Document. </p>
<p>General Notes About Shipping Documents </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet">Shipping Documents that have a <span style="font-style: italic;">CLOSED</span> 
	 status are view-only and can only be edited with a manager’s override, 
	 if allowed by your store’s policy. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">The number of expected items in a Shipping Document 
	 created at the store will always be zero. Only documents created by 
	 the home office and downloaded to the store will show an expected 
	 quantity. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">The Shipping Document status determines the menu 
	 options that are available at the Shipping Maintenance screen. For 
	 example, the View Packing List option is only available when the Shipping 
	 Document is saved and the packing list has been created. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">You cannot add new items to a Shipping Document 
	 that was created by the home office and downloaded to your store. 
	 Only the items expected in a downloaded document can be shipped. You 
	 must create a new Shipping Document to ship items from your store 
	 that were not specified by the home office. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">At the item entry prompt you can scan each item 
	 individually and Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service increments 
	 the total by one each time you scan an item. If you enter an item 
	 ID manually, Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service prompts for the 
	 total number to be shipped for this item ID. You can also scan an 
	 item ID and then select the Edit Item, Change Quantity options to 
	 enter the total number of items counted for this shipment.</li>
