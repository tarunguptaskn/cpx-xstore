<h1>Pre-Sale</h1>
<p>Customer Lookup: Associating a Customer With the Sale</p>
<p>If a customer is not required for this transaction, select the Skip 
 option to continue with the sale process. If you decide to associate a 
 customer with this transaction later, select Customer Options and then 
 choose the Assign Customer option on the Register Sale screen to display 
 the Customer Lookup form. </p>
<p>When applicable, use the Change Country menu option to modify the drop-down 
 State options and further refine your search. In the example below, the 
 search is for Nancy Smith and the country has been changed to Canada so 
 that the drop-down options contain Canadian Provinces (New Brunswick).</p>

<p>If the customer has a loyalty card, you may swipe it. You may also manually 
 enter the customer’s number or name, loyalty number, or enter other customer 
 information in the Customer Lookup form and select Process to continue. 
 </p>
<p>Commissioned Associates</p>
<p>If your store tracks the associates’ sales for commissions and sales 
 goals, you may be prompted to select a commissioned associate (or associates) 
 to be linked to the sale transaction. </p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>If prompted, add a commissioned associate to the sale transaction 
	 through one of two methods:</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Select the sale associate to be associated 
 with this transaction from the list and press [Enter]. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&lt;OR&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Select the Select By Associate ID menu option 
 to enter the associate’s ID and press [Enter]. </p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
	<li>The system adds the associate to the sale transaction and the associates’ 
	 names are shown on the View Port.</li>
</ol>
<table style="margin-top: 7px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" 
		 cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;" />
