<h1>Mid-Day Deposit</h1>
<p>Mid-Day Deposit allows you to place funds into the store bank (safe) 
 during the course of a working session. This activity is not necessarily 
 restricted to a specific time, and may be used as often as necessary. 
 </p>
<p>The Count Summary screen displays a list of tender groups that may be 
 removed from the till and deposited in the store bank. </p>
<ol type="1">
	<li class="Numbering">Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through 
	 the list and select a count group. Select the Count Selected option.</li>
	<li class="Numbering">Enter each value as required in the focus bar 
	 and press [Enter]. The tender type you select and your system’s configuration 
	 determine the type of count you must perform. &#160;</li>
	<li class="Numbering">If additional funds are to be placed into the 
	 store bank, select the Next Group option. </li>
	<li class="Numbering">Repeat steps 2-3 until you've counted all tender 
	 groups to be deposited, select the Summary option to return to the 
	 Count Summary screen.</li>
	<li class="Numbering">Review the deposit amounts. If they are correct, 
	 select the Done Counting option. The system prints a receipt for the 
	 Mid-Day deposit.</li>
