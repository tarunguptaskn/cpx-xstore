<h1>Closing the Store</h1>
<p>The store is closed to lock out certain business transaction functionality. 
 The store close process clears daily data, accepts downloads from the 
 home office, and prepares your store to open for a new business day. The 
 store close is divided into multiple, individual processes. Oracle Retail 
 Xstore Point of Service guides you through each step in the process. </p>
<p>To begin the store close, all of the tills and registers must be closed 
 for the business date and all associates should be signed off, except 
 for the closing associate and the till open for that register. The store 
 bank must be counted and reconciled. </p>
<p>The store close function is highly configurable and your process may 
 be different from the instructions below. Every effort has been made to 
 include notes or examples of additional steps that may be configured for 
 your store. </p>

	<tr>
		<td><p><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">Note</span>: 
		 If your store has a <span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">lead 
		 register where the database is hosted, the lead register must 
		 be the last register closed. If you attempt to close the lead 
		 register before all other registers are closed, the system prompts 
		 you to close the other registers before closing the lead register.</span></p></td>

	<li class="Numbering">At the Store Close Confirmation Prompt, Select 
	 Yes to begin the store close process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service verifies that all registers are 
 closed. If any registers are still open, the system displays a list of 
 open registers and prompts you to close each register before the store 
 close process can continue. </p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
	<li class="Numbering">If prompted, select the bank or institution for 
	 the bank deposit and select Ok.</li>
	<li class="Numbering">Depending upon the configuration of your system, 
	 you may be prompted to enter a message that will display when the 
	 store is opened for the next business day. Type a message and select 
	 Ok.</li>
	<li class="Numbering">Depending upon your system’s configuration, you 
	 may be prompted with other messages concerning the status of various 
	 functions within the store. <span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">Acknowledge 
	 these messages by pressing [Enter] to continue with the store close 
	 process. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>If configured, you may be prompted to enter the amount to be deposited 
 in the bank at the Store Bank Closing Count screen. </p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
	<li class="Numbering">Count the tenders for deposit and select the 
	 Done Counting option when you are finished.</li>
	<li class="Numbering">Press [Enter] to begin the nightly close process. 
	 Some events that occur during a nightly close are configurable. For 
	 example, certain reports may be generated at every closing.</li>
</ol>
<p>From this point on, no user intervention is required and the store closing 
 process begins. The Message indicator on the status bar may display information 
 about the process as it is occurring. The closed store status is indicated 
 by the color change (green to yellow, or green to red) in the Store status 
 area of the screen. </p>
