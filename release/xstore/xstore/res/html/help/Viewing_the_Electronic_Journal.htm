<h1>Viewing the Electronic Journal</h1>
<p>The electronic journal is an electronically-captured record of all transactions. 
 The search capabilities allow you to quickly locate any transaction and 
 to view the detailed information on the receipt associated with a specific 
 transaction. A Journal Report showing detailed transaction information 
 is also available. </p>
<p>The following options are available: </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">View 
	 Detail</span> - Select this option to view additional information 
	 about the selected transaction. Some transaction types, such as Assign 
	 Till transaction type and Workstation Open transaction type, do not 
	 show any detailed information. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Reprint 
	 Receipt/Rebate Receipt</span> &#160;- Select one of these options 
	 to reprint a receipt or to print a rebate receipt for the selected 
	 transaction. The receipt is clearly labeled as a reprint or a rebate 
	 receipt. If reprints of the receipts are not permitted for the transaction 
	 type you selected, Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service displays 
	 a message indicating that reprints are not allowed. You must acknowledge 
	 the message to return to the Electronic Journal screen. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Gift 
	 Receipt</span> - Select this option to print a gift receipt for the 
	 selected transaction. If gift receipts are not permitted for the transaction 
	 type you selected, Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service prompts with 
	 a message indicating that gift receipts are not allowed. You must 
	 acknowledge the message to return to the Electronic Journal screen. 
	 </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Post 
	 Void</span> - Select this option to post void the selected transaction. 
	 Only transactions for the current date can be post voided. If you 
	 try to post void a transaction from a previous day, the system displays 
	 a message and you are not permitted to post void the transaction. 
	 </li>
</ul>
<table style="border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" cellspacing="0" 
		 width="100%" border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;" />
	<tr>
		<td><p>Note: If post voids are not supported for the transaction 
		 type you selected, Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service prompts 
		 with a message indicating that it is not allowed. You must acknowledge 
		 the message to return to the Electronic Journal screen. </p>
		<p>If the transaction is an extended transaction type such as a 
		 remote send or a work order, Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service 
		 displays a message and prompts you to respond. An extended transaction 
		 includes other activities after the initial transaction is completed. 
		 Post voiding an extended transaction impacts the other activities 
		 that followed the initial transaction. If you want to continue 
		 with the post void, select Yes to void the transaction; otherwise 
		 select No.</p></td>
