<h1>Receiving Inventory</h1>
<p>The Receiving functions in Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service allow 
 you to process a shipment that has arrived and record the actions that 
 are performed on it. The receiving options allow you to document merchandise 
 that has been shipped to the store from the home office or distribution 
 center and is accompanied by an advanced shipping notice (the ASN in a 
 Receiving Document). </p>
<p>Although Receiving Documents are usually downloaded from the home office, 
 you can also create a Receiving Document in your store. </p>
<p>A variety of shipment types may be received. They include shipments 
 such as special orders, work orders, vendor shipments and store transfers. 
 After a shipment arrives, you can count items, add comments, change quantities, 
 add cartons, and ultimately, close the receiving document. When the receiving 
 document is closed, inventory is updated. </p>
<p>Each Receiving Document has an identifying number for the entire shipment. 
 Each carton belonging to the shipment also has an identifying number. 
 The Receiving Document and carton numbers usually appear on a label or 
 shipping document that is affixed to each carton. A detailed list of the 
 items in each carton is also sent. </p>
<p>About Receiving Documents </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet">If you know a Receiving Document does not exist, 
	 you can select the Add New option at the Document Search form to create 
	 a new Receiving Document. For example, if a shipment arrives in your 
	 store without an accompanying Receiving Document, you can create the 
	 document so that the shipment can be received. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">If you enter a Document ID and the specific document 
	 you are looking for is not found, you can search for the document 
	 at other stores by selecting the Search All Stores option at the Search 
	 Results form. This option is only available if your system is configured 
	 for centralized lookups. Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service queries 
	 the centralized database for the Receiving Document. Use this function 
	 if you receive a shipment that is intended for another location. You 
	 can receive the shipment so that the home office knows its location, 
	 and then perform a store transfer to ship the shipment to the correct 
	 store, or follow the instructions for the shipment as instructed by 
	 the home office. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">If the document you are looking for is not found 
	 in the list of Receiving Documents, select the New option at the Receiving 
	 Document Search Results form to create a new Receiving Document. </li>
