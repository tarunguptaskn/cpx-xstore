<h1>Counting Inventory</h1>
<p>If you do not have an inventory count document downloaded from the home 
 office, you can create a new document at the store. Oracle Retail Xstore 
 Point of Service provides a number of different types of inventory counts 
 to meet your particular requirements. An inventory count type must be 
 selected when you decide to begin an inventory count. </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Physical 
	 Inventory</span> - Counting all in-stock items at a particular time. 
	 </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Cycle 
	 Count</span> - Counting a subset of the entire stock. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Lab Count</span> 
	 - A specialized count of laboratory supplies only. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Supply 
	 Count</span> - A specialized count of internally-used supplies, rather 
	 than saleable items. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Location-Based 
	 Inventory</span> - Counting items that are limited to a defined inventory 
	 location. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Item-Based 
	 Inventory</span> - Counting items on a list, regardless of their inventory 
	 locations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the on-screen prompts to create and find the count documents, 
 create worksheets, and count the on-hand merchandise.</p>
