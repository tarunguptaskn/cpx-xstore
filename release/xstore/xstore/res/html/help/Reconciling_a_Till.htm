<h1>Reconciling a Till</h1>
<p>The final check of a till is performed at till reconciliation, when 
 the till is counted and checked against the expected amount in the till. 
 Following till reconciliation, the till is closed. </p>
<p>Prerequisites: The following steps must be completed before you can 
 reconcile a till: </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet">The till must have an ENDCOUNT status. The associate 
	 has performed a close count on the till. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">The till has been removed from the register. The 
	 associate has performed the Remove Till function at the register. 
	 </li>
	<li class="Bullet">The till has been returned, indicating the till 
	 has been transferred from the control of the associate to the cash 
	 manager. The cash manager has marked the till as returned using the 
	 Issue/Return function. </li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
	<li class="Numbering">Select a till to reconcile from the list of tills, 
	 count the tenders at the Reconcile Count screen, and select Done Counting 
	 when finished.</li>
	<li class="Numbering">The system records the information, prints a 
	 reconcile receipt for your records, and returns to the Till Management 
	 menu.</li>
</ol>
<table style="margin-top: 8px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;"
