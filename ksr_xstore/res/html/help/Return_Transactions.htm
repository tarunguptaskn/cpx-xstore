<h1>Return Transactions</h1>
<h2>Verified Returns (With Original Receipt, Credit Card, or from Customer 
 History): </h2>
<p>If the customer has the original receipt or credit card, the system 
 verifies that the receipt that accompanies the return, or the original 
 credit card used in the sale, is found either on the local system or the 
 home office system. When the original transaction is found, the system 
 displays the original sale information in the View Port. A return using 
 the customer’s original sale receipt or credit card to locate the transaction 
 information stored in the database is a <span style="font-style: italic;">verified 
 return</span>. </p>
<p>If a customer does not have the original receipt, or the receipt cannot 
 be verified, the return item price may be determined from the customer’s 
 purchase history, when available. If the return item can be found in the 
 customer’s purchase history record, the transaction will be processed 
 like a verified return. If the item cannot be found in the customer’s 
 purchase history record, the transaction will be processed like a blind 
 return.</p>

		<td><p>Notes About Verified Returns</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li class="Bullet">You can scan the barcode on the customer’s 
			 original receipt at the Register Scale screen rather than 
			 selecting the Return Item button. The system recognizes that 
			 this is a sale receipt barcode rather than an item identifier.</li>
			<li class="Bullet">If your store accepts cross-channel returns 
			 (for example, items purchased on your website and returned 
			 in your store), you will see a field on the Original Transaction 
			 Return Information form where you can enter the Web Order 
			 ID in order to perform a verified return. The customer must 
			 present a shipping document to process the return. If the 
			 customer does not have the shipping document for the web purchase, 
			 or the shipping document cannot be verified, you must perform 
			 a blind or unverified return. Freight, handling, or other 
			 delivery changes are not returnable.</li>
			<li class="Bullet">If the return item is a Kit composed of 
			 multiple items, all items that make up the kit must be returned. 
			 You may be prompted with a list showing all items that make 
			 up the Kit. If prompted, choose No if all component items 
			 are not available. The current return item entry will be cancelled 
			 and the system returns to the return item prompt. Choose Yes 
			 to continue with the return process to return all component 
			 items from the Kit.</li>
			<li class="Bullet">Depending upon your return policy, certain 
			 items may be returned at a prorated value from their original 
			 purchase price. If so, the amount refunded for these prorated 
			 items will be determined by the number of days between the 
			 original date of purchase and the date of return. For example, 
			 some store return policies offer a full refund if the item 
			 is returned within 30 days. After 30 days, a reduced refund 
			 (declining over time following the purchase date) will be 
			 calculated automatically.</li>

<p>When you have selected all of the return items, perform one of the following 
 functions to complete the process: </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Select Add Tenders or press [Enter] to tender the refund. </li>
	<li>Select Exit Return to return to the Register Sale screen to continue 
	 selling items. </li>
	<li>Select New Return if the customer would like to return additional 
	 items that do not appear on this original receipt. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Blind Returns &amp; Unverified Returns </h2>
<p>A <span style="font-style: italic;">blind return</span> is a return 
 without a receipt. An <span style="font-style: italic;">unverified return</span> 
 is a return where the customer’s sale receipt cannot be found in the database. 
 When all return items have been entered, you can perform the following 
 functions to complete the return process: </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Select Add Tenders or press [Enter] to tender the refund. </li>
	<li>Select Exit Return to return to the Register Sale screen to continue 
	 selling items. </li>
	<li>Select New Return if the customer would like to return additional 
	 items (for example, items that appear on an original receipt). </li>
	<li>Select Change Item to modify an item: You may change quantity, 
	 change price, change tax, void line, modify discount (if the item 
	 was discounted), or change the commissioned associate. </li>
	<li>Select Add Discount if the return item is on sale at the time it 
	 is returned. Then select a type of discount from a list, and select 
	 the specific item that will be discounted. The discount you apply 
	 may be a percentage discount or a dollar amount discount. This ultimately 
	 reduces the amount due to the customer when the return is tendered. 
	 </li>
	<li>Select Add Line Item Comments to associate a comment with an item. 
	 </li>
</ul>
