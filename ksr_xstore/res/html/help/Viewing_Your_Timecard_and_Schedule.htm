<h1>Viewing Your Timecard and Schedule</h1>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">View Timecard</span> - Your 
 timecard entries for the current payroll week are displayed in a view-only 
 format; however, you can add a comment that will be linked to your timecard 
 for this payroll week.</p>
<p>With your timecard record displayed, select the Timecard Comment option 
 and type a comment in the Add Comment form that displays. The comment 
 is now associated with this record as indicated by the See Comment text 
 at the bottom of the Timecard Maintenance screen. </p>
<p>When you see an icon <img src="TimecardIcon.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" 
							 border="0" /> associated with a time clock 
 record, it indicates the record has been entered or modified through Timecard 
 Maintenance and is not the original clock-in or clock-out record, or that 
 the record has an exception to a timecard rule. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">View Work Schedule</span> 
 - Use this option to view and print your work schedule. The schedule information 
 shown here includes the hours and your work assignment for each day of

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">View Scheduled Employees</span> 
 - Use this option to view a list of associates who are scheduled to work 
 on a specific day. The information shown here includes each associate’s 
 name, work code, and their scheduled shift hours. </p>
