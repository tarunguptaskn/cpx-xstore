<h1>Special Order Transactions</h1>
<p>A Special Order transaction is typically performed when a customer wants 
 to purchase an item that is not currently available in the store. The 
 item may be out of stock or unavailable for any reason. A special order 
 item may be any saleable item from the store’s inventory. Non-inventory 
 items may also be special-ordered if your system’s configuration permits 
 it. </p>
<p>When an item is out of stock, the customer cannot take possession of 
 the item immediately, so the store orders it from a vendor, warehouse, 
 or another store. When the special order item arrives in the store, it 
 is shipped to the customer or the customer is notified to pick it up at 
 the store. </p>
<table style="margin-top: 8px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" 
		 cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;" />
	<tr>
		<td><p>Note: If the customer is returning to the store to pick 
		 up the item, the Pick Up Item menu button will not be available 
		 until the item has been received in the store. </p></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The Special Order function includes the order-entry process for a special 
 order item, entering the related customer information, and processing 
 any special fees that may be associated with the special order. </p>
<p>A special order may be shipped to the store or directly to the customer: 
 </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet">If the customer will return to the store to pick 
	 up the item, select the To Store option. A deposit may be taken for 
	 special order items shipped to the store for pickup. When items are 
	 shipped directly to the customer, they must be paid in full. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">If the customer would like to have the item shipped 
	 directly to another location, select the To Customer option. After 
	 adding special order items, you may be prompted that a shipping fee 
	 has been automatically added to the special order. </li>
</ul>
<table style="margin-top: 8px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" 
		 cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;" />
	<tr>
		<td><p>Note: When entering items for a special order, you may be 
		 notified that the item is in stock. You can choose to special 
		 order the item anyway, or return to the sale to sell the item 
		 from stock merchandise. If an item cannot be added to a special 
		 order, you are prompted with a message indicating that the item 
		 is ineligible for a special order.</p></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>During a special order setup transaction you can also perform the following 
 activities before tendering the sale: </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet">You can sell non-merchandise items that are eligible 
	 for special order. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">If you do not know the item number and cannot scan 
	 the item, use the Item Lookup option to find the item number. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">You can add or view comments about the transaction. 
	 </li>
	<li class="Bullet">You can view the special order history. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">You can cancel the special order. </li>
</ul>
