<h1>About the Back Office</h1>
<p>The Back Office area of Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service is used 
 to manage the non-retail transaction functions required to run the business. 
 Non-retail transaction options include functions such as opening/closing 
 the registers and store, managing the tills, running reports, managing 
 customer and employee records, and other administrative-type tasks. </p>
<p>Detailed information about the Back Office functions can be found in 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service 
 Manager's Guide</span>. </p>
<h2>Menu List Options </h2>
<p>Some functions on Back Office Menu lists may not be available to all 
 employees. Individual access is based on menu configuration. Security 
 may be different for each employee or employee group. </p>
<p><img src="ReportsMenuOption.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" />The 
 number to the left of a menu option represents the keyboard number that 
 executes this option. For example, pressing the number 8 on the keyboard 
 launches the Reports menu option. </p>
<p>If an option is grayed out, the option is not available to the current 
 user. This is configurable by security level and may also be unavailable 
 because a required condition has not been met. For example, some functions 
 require that a till is attached to the register in order to use the function.
