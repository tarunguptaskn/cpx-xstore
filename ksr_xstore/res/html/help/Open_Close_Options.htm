<h1>Open/Close Options</h1>
<p>The Register Close and Store Close menu options toggle between open 
 and close. The register menu option Register Close indicates that the 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">register</span> &#160;is <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>. 
 The Store Close option tells you that the <span style="font-style: italic;">store</span> 
 is currently <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>.</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Close 
	 Credit/Debit Batch</span>: Requests a Close Batch from Merchantlink 
	 (a processor for credit/debit cards).</li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Changing 
	 the Business date</span>: If no monetary transactions have been performed 
	 today, enter the new business date at the prompt. Oracle Retail Xstore 
	 Point of Service prompts you to confirm the date you entered. The 
	 new business date will be used from this point on. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Force 
	 Close</span>: If register equipment fails for any reason and a register 
	 cannot be closed using the normal procedure, the Force Close option 
	 may be used. By forcing a register to close, despite equipment failure, 
	 the store closing procedure may then be started. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">The Print 
	 Till Summary Receipt</span>: Allows you to print a summary of the 
	 tenders that were in the till when a register was closed. The receipt 
	 includes a breakdown of the various tenders (quantity and amount), 
	 a configurable list of various transactions that occurred at the register 
	 (paid in/paid out, returns, refunds, discounts, account setups, etc. 
	 and the quantity and amount for each) and taxes. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Check 
	 for Updates</span>: Allows Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service to 
	 request the download manifest on demand. This option provides the 
	 ability to bypass the scheduler normally run during the store close, 
	 and to initiate the download manifest when called.</li>
</ul>
