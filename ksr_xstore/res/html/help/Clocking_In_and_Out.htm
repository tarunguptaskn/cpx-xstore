<h1>Clocking In &amp; Out</h1>
<p>Depending upon your store policy, you may be required to clock in before 
 logging in. You may also be required to clock in and out for meal breaks. 
 If meal break clock-out and clock-in is enforced, you cannot clock back 
 in after a meal break until a specified period of time has elapsed.</p>
<h2>Clocking In and Out</h2>
<p>At the Login screen, select the Clock In/Out option. The system knows 
 your clock-in status. If you are clocked in you are prompted to clock 
 out; if you are not clocked in you are prompted to do so. </p>
<h2>Clocking In and Out From Meal Breaks</h2>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet">If a minimum clocked-in time interval for a Meal 
	 Break work code (for example, 30 minutes) is required, you cannot 
	 clock out early from your meal break. In effect, this means that once 
	 you have clocked in for your meal break, you cannot clock out from 
	 your meal break for at least 30 minutes. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">If a minimum clocked-out time interval for a break 
	 (for example, 30 minutes) is required, you cannot clock back in early. 
	 In effect, this means that once you have clocked out during your shift, 
	 you cannot clock back in again for at least 30 minutes.</li>
