<h1>Warranty/Service Plan</h1>
<table style="margin-top: 8px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" 
		 cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;" />
	<tr>
		<td><p>Note: Warranty/Service Plans are only available for designated 
		 items as determined by the home office. </p></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Items that are eligible for warranty plans but have not been associated 
 with any plan show this No Warranty Purchased symbol <img src="Warranty_Declined.gif" 
															 alt="" style="border: none;" 
															 border="0" /> 
 on the View Port. The list of warranties available for this item will 
 be listed. Select a warranty from the list if the customer would like 
 to add a warranty plan, or press [Esc] at the warranty list if the customer 
 does not want to add a warranty plan at this time.</p>
<p>Since a warranty/service plan must have an owner, you must associate 
 a customer name with the plan. The plan owner may be a different person 
 than the customer who purchases the item and the warranty/service plan. 
 For example, the customer may purchase an item as a gift and also wants 
 to assign the warranty to the person receiving the gift.</p>
<p>If the customer decides to purchase a warranty plan later, you have 
 the following options on the Warranty menu: </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Add Warranty</span> 
	 - Select this option to add a warranty to a previously-purchased item. 
	 </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Change 
	 Customer</span> - Select this option to change the owner of the warranty 
	 when the warranty information is displayed on the View Port.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding a Warranty/Service Plan </h3>
<p>To add a warranty to an item, select a source for locating a previously-purchased 
 item that will be covered by a warranty/service plan:</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;<img src="AddWarrantyOptions.png" 
											 alt="" style="border: none;" 
											 width="194" height="230" border="0" /></p>
<ul style="font-weight: normal;" type="disc">
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><p><span>Select Current Transaction 
	 if the item is in the current transaction. Use this option for customers 
	 who originally decline the warranty/service plan but change their 
	 minds </span><span style="font-style: italic;">before</span><span> 
	 the transaction is tendered. </span></p></li>
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><p><span>Select Customer History to 
	 locate the item in the customer’s purchase record. A customer must 
	 be associated with the transaction, otherwise, a message displays 
	 and indicates that no items are eligible for a warranty. Use this 
	 option if the customer does not have the original receipt, but the 
	 purchase record can be found in the purchase history for the customer. 
	 </span></p></li>
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><p><span>Select Previous Transaction 
	 with Receipt if the customer has the original receipt for the item. 
	 The system retrieves the item information from the original receipt. 
	 </span></p></li>
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><p><span>Select Manual Entry to enter 
	 the item information manually. Use this option if the customer does 
	 not have the original receipt and the purchase record cannot be found 
	 in the purchase history for the customer. </span></p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Changing the Warranty/Service Plan Customer </h3>
<ol style="font-weight: normal;" type="1">
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><p><span>Select the Change Customer 
	 option to change the owner of the warranty/service plan.</span></p></li>
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><p>The system displays a list of the 
	 warranties on the current transaction. Select the warranty/service 
	 plan you want to update and press [Enter].</p></li>
	<li style="font-weight: normal;"><p>The system prompts for customer 
	 information. Enter the information for the new warranty/service plan 
	 owner as required by your store’s policy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the sale transaction is completed, the system prints a receipt 
 with the warranty details. </p>
