<h1>Work Orders</h1>
<p>Work Orders are labor services requested by a customer and performed 
 by the retailer or an outside contractor. They may be further sub-classified 
 as repairs or alterations. </p>
<p>Tasks are the detail operations that are performed on a Work Order item 
 and can be selected from a list. The system also maintains a fixed rate 
 of cost for the task, a description, and a free-form comment field that 
 may be used to describe the task to be performed. For example, a comment 
 may contain the specific text to engrave or embroider on an item. </p>
<p>The item for a work order may be added to the transaction from several 
 sources: </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Current 
	 Transaction</span> - The item is in the current sale transaction. 
	 This option is only available if there is at least one item in the 
	 current sale transaction. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Previous 
	 Transaction with Receipt</span> - The item is identified on the receipt 
	 from a previous transaction. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">No Receipt</span> 
	 - The item has no receipt available or is not referenced on a receipt. 
	 </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Customer 
	 History</span> - Find the item by searching the customer’s previous 
	 purchase transaction history. </li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Item 
	 Not on File</span> - The item requiring work is not in the system. 
	 </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have identified the item or items for the work order, you are 
 prompted to select a work order category. Categories may include repairs, 
 alterations, or any other categories that are determined by your store 
 operations. </p>
<p>The next step is to choose the tasks to be performed on the item. The 
 list of options will depend upon the work order category you selected. 
 </p>
<table style="margin-top: 8px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" 
		 cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;" />
	<tr>
		<td><p>Note: A task may or may not have a cost associated with 
		 it. If it does not have a cost, it may be an Estimate. All estimates 
		 must be converted to actual amounts before the customer can pick 
		 up the item. Price categories such as No Charge and Warranty have 
		 zero amounts in the Charge column on the Task List form.</p></td>

<h2>Task Maintenance</h2>
<p>Task maintenance functions allow you to modify the work order tasks 
 by adding new tasks, deleting work order tasks, and to add additional

	 Estimate</span> - Select this option to change an estimated cost amount

	 what the final cost of performing the task will be, and it is assigned 
	 when the work order is created. After the task is completed, the actual 
	 cost is known, and the estimate must be converted so that an accurate
