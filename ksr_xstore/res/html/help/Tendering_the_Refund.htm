<h1>Tendering the Refund</h1>
<p>Refund tenders are the tendering types used when money is owed to the 
 customer. The tender types available for sales may be different than those 
 available for returns. </p>
<h2>Verified Return </h2>
<p>If you performed a verified return using the customer’s original receipt, 
 or the item/transaction is found in the customer’s purchase history, Oracle 
 Retail Xstore Point of Service retrieves and displays the original credit 
 card information if the original sale was tendered with a credit card.</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet">To refund the return to the original credit card, 
	 press [Enter]. </li>
	<li class="Bullet">To use a different refund tender type, press [Esc] 
	 and select a refund tender from the tender list as described below. 
	 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Refund Tender List </h2>
<ol type="1">
	<li class="Numbering">Use the up or down arrow keys to select a tender 
	 type for the refund and then press [Enter].</li>
	<li class="Numbering">Enter the amount of the refund for this refund 
	 tender type and then press [Enter].</li>
	<li class="Numbering">If a prompt appears asking if the sale is complete. 
	 Press [Y] for Yes, to continue and print the receipt. You may also 
	 press [N] for No, to return to the Refund Tender Screen and select 
	 another option. The customer refund amount may be split among the 
	 different kinds of refund tenders that appear on the list.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a prompt for the type of receipt appears (Email, Print Only), select 
 the receipt method or press [Esc] to return to the Refund Tender Screen 
 and select another option. </p>
