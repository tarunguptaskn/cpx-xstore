<h1>Cash Pickup</h1>
<p>Your system’s configuration may specify the maximum amount that should 
 be kept in a till. If that amount is exceeded after completing the tendering 
 process for a transaction, the system will display a prompt indicating 
 that a cash pickup should be made. However, you do not have to wait for 
 this prompt to make a cash pickup. </p>
