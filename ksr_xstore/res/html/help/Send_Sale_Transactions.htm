<h1>Send Sale Transactions</h1>
<p>A send sale item is an item that must be shipped to a customer-specified 
 off site location after it is purchased.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Send sales</span> are similar to special 
 orders and orders because each of these transaction types may involve 
 the direct shipment of a purchased item to a customer or third party. 
 A send sale, however, implies that the item is in the store’s saleable 
 inventory when the purchase is made and is available at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>A <span style="font-style: italic;">special order</span> can be set 
 up if an item is not available in the store's inventory when the purchase 
 is made. A special order may allow a flexible payment structure between 
 the time of purchase and receipt of the merchandise, but a send sale item 
 must be paid in full when it is purchased.</p>
<p>An order can be set up if an item is not available in the store's inventory 
 when the purchase is made, however, the item must be available at another 
 location within the store chain or warehouse.</p>
