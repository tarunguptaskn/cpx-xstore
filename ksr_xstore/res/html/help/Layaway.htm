<h1>Layaway</h1>
<p>A layaway item is a sale item that cannot be taken from a store when 
 it is purchased because the customer does not pay the entire cost of the 
 item at that time. Instead, the store reserves the item for the customer 
 until the customer pays for the item in full. Usually the customer is 
 required to fully pay for the items in a layaway within a specified time 
 period. Once an item in a layaway has been fully paid, the customer takes 
 possession of it from the store. </p>
<p>A layaway account is a customer account that includes one or more layaway 
 items. A layaway account for which the customer does not pay the requisite 
 amount within a given time frame is considered delinquent; the items in 
 the layaway are restocked as saleable inventory and any non-refundable 
 deposit or setup fees are kept by the store. Any refundable deposits or 
 setup fees are reserved for the customer. </p>
<ol type="1">

<h2>Modifying a Layaway Account</h2>
<p>A layaway account may be modified during the initial creation of the 
 layaway account until the setup has been completed. </p>
<h3>Cancelling a Layaway </h3>
<p>When you choose to cancel a layaway, the system prompts you to confirm 
 whether or not the customer is present at the time of cancellation. </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>If the customer is not present, the system requires that the account 
	 be closed by using the Layaway Accounts Maintenance, escrow account 
	 function in the Back Office. Contact your manager for more information 
	 about layaway escrow accounts. </li>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">If the 
	 customer is present, complete the transaction by selecting a refund 
	 tender from the tender list. The tender list is restricted to only 
	 those tender types permitted as refunds for cancellation of a layaway 
	 account.</span><span> </span></li>
