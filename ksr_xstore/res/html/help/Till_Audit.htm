<h1>Till Audit</h1>
<p>Till Audit provides the capability to select a tender type, record its 
 total current value, and see if that value balances with the amount that 
 the system shows for the same tender. The system calculates and displays 
 any difference (over/short) between the two amounts. </p>
<p>A till audit may be performed any time after the Beginning Count and 
 before the Ending Count. The till does not need to be removed after the 
 audit is completed. </p>
<p>A till audit does not adjust the till counts, it is used only to count 
 the till while it is attached to a register. </p>
