<h1>Logging In</h1>
<p>No transactions can be entered into Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service 
 until you log in at the Register Login screen. This prevents unauthorized 
 personnel from accessing the register. Logging in also allows the system 
 to record each associate’s sales, calculate commissions, and compare sales 
 to employee goals.</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li class="Numbering">To log in, scan or key your employee ID number 
	 and press [Enter].</li>
	<li class="Numbering">When prompted, type your password and press [Enter]. 
	 </li>
</ol>
<table style="margin-top: 4px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" 
		 cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;" />
	<tr>
		<td style="vertical-align: middle;"><p>Biometric Fingerprint Scans</p>
		<p>If your system is set up to use a Biometric Fingerprint device, 
		 scan your fingerprint rather than entering your user ID and password. 
		 You will not be prompted to enter your password if you scanned 
		 your finger. Keyed entry and card scan are also supported. </p></td>

<p>You may be able to access several functions in Oracle Retail Xstore 
 Point of Service without being logged in to the register. For example, 
 you may be able to perform item lookups and to view your work schedule 
 before logging in. The available functions are determined by the home 
 office and your store policy.</p>
