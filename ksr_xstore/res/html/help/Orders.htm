<h1>Orders</h1>
<p>Use this Order functionality to sell an item that is not in stock at 
 your store and the Order Broker module will automatically select 
 the best location to fulfill the customer’s order across the enterprise. 
 There are multiple purchasing options available, such as same-store pickup, 
 different store pickup, and delivery to a customer-specified address. 
 You can track and maintain the orders using the Back Office Customer Maintenance 
 function. See the <span style="font-style: italic;">Oracle Retail Xstore 
 Point of Service Manager’s Guide</span> for more information about Back 
 Office processing. </p>

<p>Available Options for Orders:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Pickup 
	 Other Store</span> - &#160;If an item is not available in your store, 
	 use this option to find another Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service 
	 store location in which the item is currently available. The customer 
	 can pick up the item from that store.</li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Customer 
	 Delivery</span> - If an item is not available in your store, use this 
	 option to have the item shipped directly to the customer’s home (or 
	 specified address).</li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Pickup 
	 This Store</span> - If an item is not available in your store, use 
	 this option to have the item shipped here for pickup at a later time.</li>
	<li class="Bullet"><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Web/Phone 
	 Order (Fulfillment only)</span> - If the customer uses another channel 
	 (for example, web, call center, etc.) to create an order for pickup 
	 at a selected Oracle Retail Xstore Point of Service store location, 
	 your store may be identified as the fulfilling location. Refer to 
	 the <span style="font-style: italic;">Oracle Retail Xstore Point of 
	 Service Manager’s Guide</span> for more information about fulfilling 
	 orders. </li>
