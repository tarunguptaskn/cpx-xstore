<h1>Sale Tenders</h1>
<p>Tendering is the last step that occurs just before a sale is completed. 
 You must select a form of payment or refund, and it may involve check 
 or credit card authorizations, if any of these tender types are selected. 
 </p>
<p>For all tender types, you must select or enter two basic items of information: 
 </p>
<ol type="1">
	<li class="Numbering">Form of payment (also called tender type; i.e., 
	 cash, check, credit card, etc.) </li>
	<li class="Numbering"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;">Amount 
	 paid for each selected tender type</span> </li>
</ol>
<p>A customer may use multiple tenders when paying for an item. This is 
 called split tenders. After the first tender has been added, the screen 
 automatically returns to the sale tender list. Use the up and down arrow 
 keys to select the second method of payment. </p>
<table style="margin-top: 5px; border-collapse: separate; border-collapse: separate;" 
		 cellspacing="0" width="100%" border="1">
	<col style="width: 100%;" />
	<tr>
		<td><p>Notes:</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Grayed-out text indicates this tender cannot be used for 
			 this type of transaction or the option is not available at 
			 this time.</li>
			<li><span>Select Back to Sell Item to return to the sale screen 
			 where you can add more items or re-tender with another tender 
			 type. This option is only available before adding any tenders.</span></li>
		</ul></td>
	</tr>
