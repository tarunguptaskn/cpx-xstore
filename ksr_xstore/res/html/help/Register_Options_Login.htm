<p>Till options and maintenance functions are secured functions and require 
 you to log in to access the menus. The functions here are primarily related 
 to the movement of money into and out of a till. Till options include 
 Paid In and Paid Out, No Sale, Post Void, Foreign Currency Maint., Tender 
 Exchange, and Change Float. Several other till maintenance options deal 
 with the control and auditing of funds in the till. They include Cash 
 Pickup, Cash Transfer, Till Audit, and Mid-Day Deposit. Finally, the Lock 
 Register option provides physical security for the till.</p>
