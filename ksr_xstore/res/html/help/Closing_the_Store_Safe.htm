<h1>Closing the Store Bank</h1>
<p>You must reconcile the store bank before closing the store. If prompted, 
 enter the amount to be deposited in the bank at the Store Bank Closing 
 Count screen. Count the tenders for deposit and select the Done Counting 
 option when you are finished. If there is a difference between your count 
 and the amount that the system expected, a message displays. You may return 
 to the Count Summary screen and make changes or accept the difference.</p>
